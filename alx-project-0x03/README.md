# 0. Implementing a share layout

Objective: In most applications, you will have multiple pages that share similar Layout (i.e. Header and Footer). This can be achieved in multiple ways. You have already seen how you can do this by reusing your Header and Footer Components on Multiple pages. But there is a better way to do this and that is through the DRY framework. Set up a base application using create-next-app@latest with the name alx-project-0x03 in a Github repository alx-project-0x03-setup .

# 1. Importing Google fonts

Objectives: By default your project will include some tailwindcss configurations. We can import a google font to be included in the global space of our tailwindcss. We will see how to do this in our global.css file.

# 2. Setting up our landing page with Imperative routing

Objectives: Our App will have 3 additional mini apps. This can be accessible through imperative routing. Which means we need to use the Link component explicitly but by using useRouter Hook from next/router.

We will modify our index.tsx file to achieve this functionality

# 3. Move your interfaces to the right directory

Objectives: Clean up your code a bit, remember, it is always good to keep your code well organized. Group your files into the right directories.
